## Firstly, hi, I'm Luca, and this is my thing.
Here you'll find half-assed projects and forks that haven't had a single commit.
Seriously, I do a lot of web development. I enjoy doing it at the moment.
I don't want it to become my only thing, though! Making some desktop apps will be fun! But what would I make? That leads me onto this...

## Choosing stuff to make
I'll keep it short. There's always apps that do the exact same thing. It's hard, because it feels like everyone's already taken all the good ideas for stuff!
This is why I make Fall Guys things. Fall Guys is kinda niche nowadays, and what's even more niche is making websites for it.
It's like my sort of fan art. I can't draw myself, so why not do something else that's creative instead...

## As for languages...
You see, I have a habit for learning the very basics of a programming language then just making a project.
With something like CSS, that's not really a problem. You can just look it up and move on. It's usually plain and simple to understand.
As for Python, JavaScript or VBA (yes, I used to make PowerPoint OSes), understanding is important.

## Projects
I'm in the Fall Guys community (I know, the game died after *Among Us* came around.) I don't actually enjoy the game anymore to be honest. I just know people who do, and I make Fall Guys-based websites and projects.

There's two main projects I'm gonna talk about, one out and one in the works.
Firstly, there's [Level Idea Generator](https://lucamakesstuff.com/LevelIdeaGenerator). It generates a random Fall Guys level idea for you at the click of a button.
Let's be honest, it's kind of stupid, you'll never get a good idea out of not-so-random "randomness". It's when I first learnt about hosting, and how the internet actually works.

Right now, I'm working on ReviewGuys - a website where you can get your Fall Guys creative levels reviewed and played by others. Instead of paying, I've gone for the easier and less expensive route with Supabase.
I'm hosting with Vercel for all my stuff but I should probably get a server of my own in the future. Just a little machine that you can slap LAMP stuff on and you're done!
Nothing super expensive, just something that can hold a few people on it at a time.
